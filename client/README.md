#### Tests
Some tests don't have any assertions. If those are graphql related, then that's because I couldn't find a way to put an assertion in the actual test, but it _will still throw an error_ if the test fails (the error might look like `(node:25601) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: No more mocked responses for the query: mutation`, which doesn't give too much information, but at least you can see that something's wrong).
